###Puzzle concepts

There should be around 2-3 puzzle rooms in the game

##Puzzle 1
You walk into a dimly lit room. You can only see some kind of barrier, button and a power up on the other side of you. 
As you active the button, the room lights up and you can see a big circuit board in the middle of the room. A bunch of cables
go through it. You can then with a number of levers rotate the board in order to connect it to different platforms.
After a cable is connected to a platform, the powerbutton can be used to activate and disable the platform.

The puzzle is that you have to somewhat climb the different platforms and correctly turning the circuit and activating the
correct platforms.

##Puzzle 2
This puzzle should feature the "simulation-exits" and movable blocks(in this case probably desks). This also shouldn't be a 
terribly hard puzzle, as it introduces the player to a bunch of new things. 

It goes like this: the player walks into a room finding themselves unable to get past this point. A chair acts as the conduit 
between the simulation and the real world. The player needs to enter this world, push a bunch of desks in order to enter a 
secret room. From there you should be able to use a console to drastically change something in the simulation. As you head back
there, the change you made will have made it possible for you to continue.

##Puzzle 3
A combination of a bunch of things, but mostly using the twin-world mechanic in order to change the world somehow. 
Create a real hard puzzle that uses everything you have in the game and gives you the final item of the game. 
Now go to the last boss and use it on him!
