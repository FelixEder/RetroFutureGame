###Item concepts

##Items to pick up

- A stone, can be found around the different areas of the game. You can hold one at a time. You can use it as a weapon 
 (replaces punches). It can also be thrown in a curved throw. Can be used in puzzles and as a projectile.
 
- A branch, can also be found laying around in the forests. Can be used as a weapon with longer range (replaces punches).
  Can be used to reach higher things as well as some puzzle usage (maybe building bridges somehow?)
  
- Simple keys and keycards could be used when wanting to open certain doors and such.

##Power ups

- At least one power up should be nature-focused, it could be some sort of leaf that could let you float for a longer time
 (making certain jumps easier).
 
- An old piece of technology that introduces an interesting new mechanic to the game and puzzles. It could be something
 like creating a clone of yourself that stays in a certain spot for a number of seconds. (Maybe a bit to hard to simply implement in the game.)
 
 - A cane that shoots a straight laser forwards, this could be used in puzzles where you need to hit certain targets through glass
  or something (could also be used as a weapon, it does sound a bit OP however).
  
 - A simple double jump
 
 - A hat that hits everything above you, including certain blocks you need to hit
 
 - A wall-jump, adds an ability to perform wall-jumps when sliding down a ledge.
 
 - Some kind of boot that allows you to kick the ground and destroy certain blocks in some way.
 
 - Some gizmo that makes you able to crawl through small spaces.


##Collectibles

- Something that will increase your health if you collected enough of them.

- If your later futuristic items require some sort of ammo, an obvious choice could be to increase your ammo capacity.
