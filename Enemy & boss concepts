###Enemy & boss concepts

##Enemies

1- A quadratic Goomba-like creature that simply walks left and changes to right if it hits a wall or equal.

2- An similiar enemy but twice as big and has a really thich shell. This requires the player to use a stone or mecha-hand
to destroy shell and reveal the softer enemy on the inside. This can at first be a mini-boss which then becomes a regular enemy.

3- An enemy with a impenetrable skin, it's only weak spot is an eye that can be poked at with a stick or the ray gun.

4- A jumping version of number 1, jumps back and forth, making your life miserable.


##Bosses

- The statue
A giant statue in a huge room. It can't move, but when you enter the room and pass a certain spot, the music changes
and room changes color. The statue fires lasers from it's mouth, but it's always clear when and where the statue will be firing. 
The goal is to climb the statue, avoid it's simple attacks and reach it's mouth. A few branches lies in it's mouth, these can
be picked up. Then continue climbing the statue until you reach it's eyes. Poke each eye 2-3 times and it will crumble.
You wake up in it's ruins and can continue your journey. The remains of the statue should always be seen in this room.

- The Burrower
In the lowest place in the map, a sort of mole hides. By this point you have the crawl ability, so you enter a system of tunnels.
In there, a little creature lurks. Since you cannot attack while crawling, it poses a serious danger. It has no real attacks,
but walks a certain pattern in the tunnels. Your job is to surpass it and then somehow either punch it when you have an opening
or drop something on it or something like that.

- Final Boss
Something that incorporates most of your mechanics in an epic boss fight. Should end with a timer which forces you to run all
the way back to your entry point on the chair.
