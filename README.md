# RetroFutureGame
This game will be a 2D Metroidvania, alas a semi-open world where you progress by finding the correct power ups and explore the world.

The setting:
You wake up in a jungle, here you have make your way through the exotic forests. Along the way, you start to see ruins of ancient structures and other mystical things. Later on in the game you can access the past, which is the ruins you have been seing, in their prime. This means that you can start going between these two worlds, changing them and along the way empowering you character to unbelievable heights.

Gameplay:
The game plays as a simple platformer with some added combat. You can fight with your fists but also by picking up smaller items for limited use. Later on in the game you will find power ups that permanently add to your abilities. There are also puzzle-rooms that make use of your abilities in clever ways.


Scope:
The game should be rather short, not being longer than max 30 minutes. You should be able to explore for a bit and find secrets that could drag on the playability.
