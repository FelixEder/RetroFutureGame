###Item concepts

##Items to pick up

- A stone, can be found around the different areas of the game. You can hold one at a time. You can use it as a weapon 
 (replaces punches), but has a limited use until it breaks. It can also be thrown in a curved throw. Can be used in puzzles and as a projectile.
 
- A branch, can also be found laying around in the forests. Can be used as a weapon with longer range (replaces punches).
  Can be used to reach higher things as well as some puzzle usage (maybe building bridges somehow?)
  
- Simple keys and keycards could be used when wanting to open certain doors and such. (will probably not be implemented)

##Power ups

- At least one power up should be nature-focused, it could be some sort of leaf that could let you float for a longer time
 (making certain jumps easier).
 
- An old piece of technology that introduces an interesting new mechanic to the game and puzzles. It could be something
 like creating a clone of yourself that stays in a certain spot for a number of seconds. (Maybe a bit to hard to simply implement in the game.)
 (will probably not be implemented)
 
 - A cane that shoots a straight laser forwards, this could be used in puzzles where you need to hit certain targets through glass
  or something. Could be used when crawling in order to kill enemies and open doors and so. (Runs on energy.)
  
 - A simple double jump (will probably not be implemented)
 
 - A hat that hits everything above you, including certain blocks you need to hit
 
 - A wall-jump, adds an ability to perform wall-jumps when sliding down a ledge.
 
 - Some kind of boot that allows you to kick the ground and destroy certain blocks in some way.
 
 - Some gizmo that makes you able to crawl through small spaces.
 
 - A mecha-hand that does heavy damage with punches, breaks certain shells and blocks and sofort. (runs on energy)
 
 - Maybe make the high-jump require a bit of energy? It would act as a sort of introduction to the energy system in the game

##Collectibles

- Something that will increase your health if you collected enough of them.

- The later items require energy, there should both be enemy drops that replaces lost energy and collectibles that
  increases the maximum energy the player has.
  
- A small speed-increase, each one you get increases your movement speed somewhat. Could create an interesting dynamic in
 as speedrun. Should you take the time to find all speed increase power-ups or should you just try to complete the game?
