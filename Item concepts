###Item concepts

##Items to pick up

- A stone, can be found around the different areas of the game. You can hold one at a time. You can use it as a weapon 
 (replaces punches). It can also be thrown in a curved throw. Can be used in puzzles and as a projectile.
 
- A branch, can also be found laying around in the forests. Can be used as a weapon with longer range (replaces punches).
  Can be used to reach higher things as well as some puzzle usage (maybe building bridges somehow?)
